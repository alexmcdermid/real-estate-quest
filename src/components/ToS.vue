          Welcome to Real Estate Quest! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Real Estate Quest website and services (collectively, the "Service") provided by Real Estate Quest ("we," "us," or "our").
        </p>

          By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-h6 mt-6 mb-2">1. Use of Service</h3>
        <p>Real Estate Quest grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial learning purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>

        <h3 class="text-h6 mt-6 mb-2">2. User Accounts</h3>
        <p>You may need to register for an account to access certain features. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information updated. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h3 class="text-h6 mt-6 mb-2">3. Payments, Subscriptions, and Refunds</h3>
        <p>Certain features of the Service require payment ("Paid Services") and are available either as a recurring monthly subscription or a one-time purchase.</p>
        <ul class="ml-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Billing:</strong>
            <ul>
               <li class="mt-2"><strong>Monthly Subscription:</strong> If you choose the monthly subscription option, you will be billed $25.00 CAD per month (plus applicable taxes) in advance on a recurring basis. Your subscription begins upon successful payment and automatically renews each month unless cancelled.</li>
               <li class="mt-2"><strong>One-Time Purchase:</strong> If you choose the one-time purchase option, you will be charged a single fee of $99.00 CAD (plus applicable taxes). This purchase grants you indefinite access to the features designated as Paid Services at the time of purchase, for as long as the Service is operated, subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service (including Section 10 regarding Termination).</li>
             </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All payments made in connection with the Service are processed by our third-party payment processor, Stripe. You agree to provide accurate payment information to Stripe and are subject to Stripe's terms and conditions (<a href="https://stripe.com/legal/consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/legal/consumer</a>) and privacy policy (<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>). We do not process or store your full payment card details.</li>
          <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> All payments for Paid Services (both monthly subscriptions and one-time purchases) are final and non-refundable, except where required by applicable law. Please review service details carefully before purchasing.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancellations (Monthly Subscription Only):</strong> You may cancel your monthly subscription at any time before the end of your current monthly billing period. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and you will retain access to the Paid Services until then. No refunds or credits will be provided for partial subscription periods. You can manage and cancel your monthly subscription via our payment processor, Stripe, by accessing the customer portal link found on the 'Pro' page accessible from the main navigation bar of the Service.</li>
          <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change the prices for Paid Services (including the monthly subscription fee) at any time. Price changes for subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change, subject to providing you with reasonable prior notice. Prices for one-time purchases are subject to change for future purchases but are fixed at the time you make your purchase.</li>
        </ul>
